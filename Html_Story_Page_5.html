        <h1>Dragon Games</h1>
        <p>It must be! I’ve seen people make each other bleed before as a part of having fun when I was traveling to collect for my horde. I’ve seen them celebrate making another bleed. It must be a part of their game! Why else would they do it? I’m going to follow them.</p>
        <p>I want to learn more about how this game is played so I can join.</p>
        <p>Wait for me! My house is too cramped for me to run properly!</p>
        <p>If the rest of the game is as fun as it is to follow them I know I’ll enjoy it! Once I reach them I hope they’ll explain the rules better. It feels so nice to stretch my legs after spending so long in that room of mine! I hope they don’t mind that I use my wings to catch up to them once we get out of the house.</p>
